[![Deploy Dev](https://github.com/JordyHers/flutter_any_logo/actions/workflows/deploy_dev.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/JordyHers/flutter_any_logo/actions/workflows/deploy_dev.yml)

## Our aim is to implement 1000+ logos but keep the package as light as possible. ü™Ω

## Installation

Add `flutter_any_logo` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```
dependencies:
  flutter_any_logo: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the plugin.

## Usage

Import the `flutter_any_logo` package in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_any_logo/flutter_any_logo.dart';
```

You can now use the provided `AnyLogo` widget to display the logos in your app. For example, to display the Instagram logo:

```dart
AnyLogo.media.instagram
```

#### More examples

```dart
import 'package:flutter_any_logo/flutter_any_logo.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          ...AnyLogo.nba.values.map((e) => e.image()).toList(),
          ...AnyLogo.fashion.values.map((e) => e.image()).toList(),
          ...AnyLogo.uefa.values.map((e) => e.image()).toList(),
          ...AnyLogo.food.values.map((e) => e.image()).toList(),
          ...AnyLogo.tech.values.map((e) => e.image()).toList(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```


`flutter_any_logo` currently supports the following categories and logos:

### Variables
if you want to have access to a type a static method is available

```dart
// Single Assets Image NBA
 AnyLogo.nba.atlantaHawks

//Access all values in a type
 AnyLogo.nba.values

//Access the image
AnyLogo.nba.image()

// Key? key,   
// AssetBundle? bundle,  
// Widget Function(BuildContext, Widget, int?, bool)? frameBuilder,
// Widget Function(BuildContext, Object, StackTrace?)? errorBuilder, 
// String? semanticLabel,  
// bool excludeFromSemantics = false, 
// double? scale,  
// double? width, 
// double? height, 
// Color? color,   
// Animation<double>? opacity,
// BlendMode? colorBlendMode,  
// BoxFit? fit, 
// AlignmentGeometry alignment = Alignment.center, 
// ImageRepeat repeat = ImageRepeat.noRepeat,  
// Rect? centerSlice, 
// bool matchTextDirection = false, 
// bool gaplessPlayback = false,
// bool isAntiAlias = false, 
// String? package, 
// FilterQuality filterQuality = FilterQuality.low, 
// int? cacheWidth,  
// int? cacheHeight,
// All the variables are sill available
AnyLogo.nba.image(height: 30);


//You can still pass just the asset image without calling [.image()]
Image(image: AssetImage(AnyLogo.nba.atlanta.path)),



```

## Test Strategy 

PNG File Upload Validation

#### Objective:
To ensure that only PNG files with a size of 400kb or less are uploaded to the application.

#### Scope:
This test strategy covers the validation of PNG file uploads in the application. Specifically, it covers the validation of PNG file types and size limits.

#### Approach:
The testing approach for this test strategy will involve a combination of manual and automated testing techniques. The automated testing will be implemented as part of the continuous integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The manual testing will be performed by the testing team. The Unit testing ensure the files are properly loaded

#### Test Types:
- Automated Testing:
  - Static code analysis to enforce linting rules for file types and size limits
- Unit Testing:
  - widget testing ensures the logos are properly loaded and rendered
- Manual Testing:
  - Functional testing to verify that PNG files with a size of 400kb or less can be uploaded successfully
  - Exploratory testing to identify any edge cases or potential issues related to PNG file uploads

#### Test Environment:
- Development environment: Flutter framework
- Operating system: Windows, MacOS, Linux
- Test environment: Local and staging servers

#### Test Data:
- PNG files with a size of 400kb or less
- Non-PNG files

#### Test Cases:
1. Verify that only PNG files with a size of 400kb or less can be uploaded.
2. Verify that an error message is displayed when attempting to upload a non-PNG file.
3. Verify that a success message is displayed when a PNG file with a size of 400kb or less is uploaded successfully.
4. Verify that the application is able to handle edge cases, such as large or corrupted PNG files.

#### Test Schedule:
- Automated testing will be performed as part of the CI pipeline for every code push or pull request.
- Manual testing will be performed on an as-needed basis during the testing phase of the development cycle.

#### Test Deliverables:
- Test plan
- Test cases
- Test results and reports
- Bug reports
- Test sign-off


This test strategy outlines the objectives, scope, approach, test types, test environment, test data, test cases, test schedule, and test deliverables for the validation of PNG file uploads in the application. It combines automated and manual testing techniques to ensure that only PNG files with a size of 400kb or less can be uploaded successfully.
